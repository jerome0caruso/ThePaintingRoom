# The Painting Room: 
#### I created this website and painting application using vanilla JavaScript, CSS3 and HTML5.  This project was a great learning experience as it focused on event listeners, callback functions using arrow syntax, location of window axes, touch events and more.  In the Paint section of the site you will find an easy to follow layout, where you can adjust the color, size of the pen or shape, pick the style of pen, choose between a circle or square shape and a clear canvas button.  This canvas also works on mobile layouts as it is fairly responsive.  For the layout and views of the site I combined CSS Grid and Flexbox to create a responsive, fresh and clean looking site.  Under the about and contact section you can find out more about me and download/view my resume, checkout my portfolio and also find and connect with me on LinkedIn.
